# Archived Documentation

This file contains the previous QUICK_START.md and portions of USAGE_GUIDE.md that were consolidated into the main README.md for easier user access.

## Note
The essential information from these documents has been integrated into README.md to provide a single, streamlined documentation source. The full USAGE_GUIDE.md remains available for advanced users who need comprehensive technical details.

## Previous Structure
- README.md - Basic overview
- QUICK_START.md - 5-minute guide
- USAGE_GUIDE.md - Comprehensive documentation

## New Structure

The consolidation was done to reduce confusion for new users who were uncertain which document to start with.
